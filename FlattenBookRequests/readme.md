App to flatten book requests from a spreadsheet. 


Uses [CsvHelper](http://joshclose.github.io/CsvHelper/) to do the conversion.

[FlattenBooks.zip](https://github.com/jquintus/QuintusPersonal/raw/master/FlattenBookRequests/FlattenBooks.zip) contains the pre-built binaries.  Just extract to a folder and run `FlattenBookRequests.exe`.  It assumes that there is a CSV file named `books.csv` on your desktop.  It will write it's output to `Flattened_books.csv`.
